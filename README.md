This program shows an example of how inheritance can be used, with Box being the parent class of FancyBox, FilledBox, and HollowBox. The functions getWidth() and getHeight() are inherited by all classes,
as well as the virtual function asString(), which is overridden by all child classes.
For visual example of the inheritances as well as an example of the outputs of each child class see Inheritance_Path_Figure.png
